// Example
var firstName = "Alan";
var lastName = "Turing";

// Only change code below this line
var myFirstName = "Alice";
var myLastName = "Rosier";


//Previously we have used the code

//var myName = "your name";

//"your name" is called a string literal. It is a string because it is a series of zero or more characters enclosed in single or double quotes.
