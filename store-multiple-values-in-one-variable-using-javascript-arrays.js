// Only change code below this line.
var myArray = ["age", 22];


//Store Multiple Values in one Variable using JavaScript Arrays
//With JavaScript array variables, we can store several pieces of data in one place.

//You start an array declaration with an opening square bracket, end it with a closing square bracket, and put a comma between each entry, like this:

//var sandwich = ["peanut butter", "jelly", "bread"].

//Instructions
//Modify the new array myArray so that it contains both a string and a number (in that order).
